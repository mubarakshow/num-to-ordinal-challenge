# Number to Ordinal Challenge
An algorithm challenge to change numbers to return the correct ordinal 
## Task
Finish the function numberToOrdinal, which should take a number and return it as a string with the correct ordinal indicator suffix (in English). For example, 1 turns into "1st".

For the purposes of this challenge, you may assume that the function will always be passed a non-negative integer.

If the function is given 0 as an argument, it should return the string "0" without a suffix. To help you get started, here is an excerpt from Wikipedia's page on Ordinal Indicators: st is used with numbers ending in 1 (e.g. 1st, pronounced first) nd is used with numbers ending in 2 (e.g. 92nd, pronounced ninety-second) rd is used with numbers ending in 3 (e.g. 33rd, pronounced thirty-third)

As an exception to the above rules, all the "teen" numbers ending with 11, 12 or 13 use -th (e.g. 11th, pronounced eleventh, 112th, pronounced one hundred [and] twelfth) th is used for all other numbers (e.g. 9th, pronounced ninth).
